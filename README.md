# Music-Generation
The Music industry is exploring the opportunities in AI:
Magenta: a research project within Google that explores how machine learning tools can help artists create art and music in new ways.
MuseNet: deep neural network that can generate 4-minute musical compositions with 10 different instruments
The Goal is to generate new music from the data that the model is trained on.
This means that the model has to understand the sequence of notes and its patterns.



The data for this model will be based on ‘Jigs’ and ‘Hornpipes’.The Jigs have 340 tunes and the hornpipes have 65 tunesThe data is available in the form of text files and in ‘ABC’ format.
The notation has two parts:
Part 1, where there are details of the index, time signature,type of tune etc
Part 2 represents the sequence of characters or notes.
